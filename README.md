## Description

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: <a href='https://timestamp-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks/' target='_blank'>https://timestamp-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks//</a>.
  ### Forked From
<a href='https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-timestamp/' target='_blank'>https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-timestamp/</a>

  ### User Stories

1. I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016)
2. If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
3. If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns a instance of now date.

#### Example output:
* { "unix": 1450137600, "natural": "December 15, 2015" }
